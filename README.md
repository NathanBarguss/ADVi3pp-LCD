## Introduction

**ADVi3++** is a fork of the Marlin Firmware for the Wanhao Duplicator i3 Plus (and its clones: Monoprice Maker Select Plus, Coccon Create). It includes both Marlin itself and customizations of the LCD screens.

# Sister project

**ADVi3++** is split into two sister projects:

* ADVi3pp-LCD: this project, a customization of the LCD resources
* [ADVi3pp-Marlin](https://github.com/andrivet/ADVi3pp-Marlin): a fork of Marlin firmware

**IMPORTANT**: You need to flash both components (LCD and Mainboard). For full explanations about **ADVi3++** and how to flash, look at the sister project [ADVi3pp-Marlin](https://github.com/andrivet/ADVi3pp-Marlin).

# Thanks

Thank you to Leo LÃ¼ker (Silverquark) for his [i3plus+](https://github.com/Silverquark/i3PlusPlus) project. I take many ideas from his code. But the project is not very active (still in Beta) and I do not like the screen (personal taste) so I have created the **ADVi3++** fork (technically, it is a fork of **Marlin**, not of **i3plus+**).

Thank to [Marlin](http://marlinfw.org) for their great work.
